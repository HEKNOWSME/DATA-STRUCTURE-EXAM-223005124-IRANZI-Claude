## 3️⃣ Hello, World! Program

**File:** `one.cpp` **Libraries Used:**

- `#include <iostream>`: Provides input-output functionality using `cout`. **Use Case:**
- The first program to write in any language.
- Prints output to the console.

**Expected Output:**

```
Hello, World!
```

## 4️⃣ Understanding Variables and Data Types

**File:** `two.cpp` **Libraries Used:**

- `#include <iostream>`: Enables output display.
- `#include <string>`: Allows usage of string variables. **Use Case:**
- Storing and manipulating data in programs.
- Defining different types of variables (int, float, char, bool, string).

**Expected Output:**

```
Enter your name: Alice
Enter your age: 20
Enter product price: 19.99
Enter your grade: A
Name: Alice
Age: 20
Price: $19.99
Grade: A
```

## 5️⃣ User Input in C++

**File:** `three.cpp` **Libraries Used:**

- `#include <iostream>`: Provides input (`cin`) and output (`cout`). **Use Case:**
- Takes user input dynamically and processes it.
- Used in interactive programs.

**Expected Output (Example User Input: John, 25):**

```
Enter your name: John
Enter your age: 25
Hello, John! You are 25 years old.
```

## 6️⃣ Operators in C++

**File:** `four.cpp` **Libraries Used:**

- `#include <iostream>`: Allows printing results of calculations. **Use Case:**
- Demonstrates arithmetic operations.
- Useful in finance, engineering, and data processing applications.

**Expected Output:**

```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 3
Sum: 13
Difference: 7
Product: 30
Quotient: 3
Remainder: 1
```
