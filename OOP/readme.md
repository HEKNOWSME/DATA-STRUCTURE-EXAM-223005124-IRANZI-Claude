## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Hello, World! Program

**File:** `one.cpp` **Libraries Used:**

- `#include <iostream>`: Provides input-output functionality using `cout`. **Use Case:**
- The first program to write in any language.
- Prints output to the console.

**Expected Output:**

```
Hello, World!
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Understanding Variables and Data Types

**File:** `two.cpp` **Libraries Used:**

- `#include <iostream>`: Enables output display.
- `#include <string>`: Allows usage of string variables. **Use Case:**
- Storing and manipulating data in programs.
- Defining different types of variables (int, float, char, bool, string).

**Expected Output:**

```
Enter your name: Alice
Enter your age: 20
Enter product price: 19.99
Enter your grade: A
Name: Alice
Age: 20
Price: $19.99
Grade: A
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ User Input in C++

**File:** `three.cpp` **Libraries Used:**

- `#include <iostream>`: Provides input (`cin`) and output (`cout`). **Use Case:**
- Takes user input dynamically and processes it.
- Used in interactive programs.

**Expected Output (Example User Input: John, 25):**

```
Enter your name: John
Enter your age: 25
Hello, John! You are 25 years old.
```

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Operators in C++

**File:** `four.cpp` **Libraries Used:**

- `#include <iostream>`: Allows printing results of calculations. **Use Case:**
- Demonstrates arithmetic operations.
- Useful in finance, engineering, and data processing applications.

**Expected Output:**

```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 3
Sum: 13
Difference: 7
Product: 30
Quotient: 3
Remainder: 1
```

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Decision Making with If-Else

**File:** `five.cpp` **Libraries Used:**

- `#include <iostream>`: Allows printing decision outcomes. **Use Case:**
- Used in conditional decision-making programs (e.g., checking age eligibility).
- Required for authentication systems and logic-based applications.

**Expected Output (Example Input: 18):**

```
Enter your age: 18
You are an adult.
```

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Loops in C++

**Files:**

- `eight.cpp` (For Loop)
- `nine.cpp` (While Loop)
- `ten.cpp` (Do-While Loop) **Libraries Used:**
- `#include <iostream>`: Enables output display. **Use Case:**
- Automates repetitive tasks.
- Common in list processing, user menu navigation, and automation scripts.

**Expected Output:**

```
Enter number of iterations: 5
This is iteration 1
This is iteration 2
This is iteration 3
This is iteration 4
This is iteration 5
```

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Functions in C++

**Files:**

- `eleven.cpp` (Function with return value)
- `twelve.cpp` (Void function example) **Libraries Used:**
- `#include <iostream>`: Allows displaying function output. **Use Case:**
- Promotes code reusability and modular programming.
- Used in complex applications requiring structured logic.

**Expected Output:**

```
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 10
The sum is: 15
Hello, Alice!
```
